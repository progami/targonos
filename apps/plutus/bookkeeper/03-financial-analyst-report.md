```

**Comparability Note:** The P&L spans ~13 months (Jan 2025 – Feb 2026), but journal entry data (Amazon settlements) only covers Dec 2025 – Jan 2026, indicating the business began meaningful sales in late 2025. The balance sheet is a point-in-time snapshot as of Feb 8, 2026. Revenue is not annualized — the actual selling period appears to be approximately 2 months.

## 2. Revenue Analysis

### 2.1 Total Revenue Composition

| Channel          | Gross Sales | Refunds    | Net Revenue | % of Net Revenue |
|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| UK-PDS           | $39,443.49  | -$592.05   | $38,851.44  | 70.7%            |
| US-PDS           | $16,413.48  | -$477.73   | $15,935.75  | 29.0%            |
| UK-CDS           | $131.08     | $0.00      | $131.08     | 0.2%             |
| **Total**        | **$55,988.05** | **-$1,069.78** | **$54,918.27** | **100%** |

### 2.2 CDS vs PDS Explained

- **PDS (Price Discount Scheme):** Seller sets their own prices and manages their own listings. The seller is the "merchant of record." This is the primary model for Targon.
- **CDS (Commingled Domestic Selling):** Amazon buys inventory at a wholesale price and resells. Minimal volume ($131) suggests a test or legacy arrangement.

### 2.3 Refund Rate Analysis

| Marketplace | Gross Sales | Refunds   | Refund Rate |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| UK-PDS      | $39,443.49  | $592.05   | 1.50%       |
| US-PDS      | $16,413.48  | $477.73   | 2.91%       |
| UK-CDS      | $131.08     | $0.00     | 0.00%       |
| **Overall** | **$55,988.05** | **$1,069.78** | **1.91%** |

**Assessment:** The overall refund rate of 1.91% is within acceptable range for Amazon FBA (industry average 2-5%). US refund rate (2.91%) is nearly double the UK rate (1.50%), which warrants monitoring but is not alarming given small sample sizes. The low refund rate suggests acceptable product quality and accurate listings.

### 2.4 Revenue Per Settlement Period (from Journal Entries)

```
Settlement Period         UK Revenue      US Revenue      Total
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Dec 2025 (partial)        $0              $10             $10
Jan 1-16, 2026 (UK)       $10,133         -               $10,133
Jan 1-16, 2026 (US)       -               $4,196          $4,196
Jan 16-30, 2026 (UK)      $19,000         -               $19,000
Jan 16-30, 2026 (US)      -               $12,207         $12,207
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Jan 2026 Total            $29,131         $16,403         $45,534
```

**Note:** The P&L total ($54,918) exceeds the journal entry total ($45,544). The difference (~$9,374) represents settlements from earlier periods (likely Oct-Nov 2025) that predate the journal entry data pulled. This confirms the business has been selling for approximately 3-4 months.

### 2.5 UK Marketplace Dominance

UK revenue represents 71% of total revenue — a significant geographic concentration risk. The UK marketplace is driving growth, with January 2026 showing strong momentum ($29K UK vs $16K US).

## 3. Cost Structure Deep-Dive

### 3.1 COGS Breakdown

```
Cost Category           Amount       % of Revenue   % of COGS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL COGS              $61,367.71   111.7%         100%
```

### 3.2 Critical Finding: COGS > Revenue

**COGS at 111.7% of revenue means the company loses money on every dollar sold BEFORE any operating expenses.** This is a pre-launch/growth-stage reality that must be addressed urgently.

### 3.3 Amazon Fee Analysis

| Fee Type       | Amount      | % of Gross Sales | Industry Benchmark | Delta  |
|----------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|--------|
| FBA Fees       | $23,132.38  | 41.3%            | 20-30%             | +11-21pp over |
| Advertising    | $22,414.12  | 40.0%            | 10-20%             | +20-30pp over |
| Seller Fees    | $8,895.27   | 15.9%            | 8-15%              | At/above top end |
| Storage        | $130.24     | 0.2%             | 1-3%               | Below (good) |

### 3.4 Advertising Cost of Sale (ACoS) Analysis

```
Total Advertising Spend:        $22,414.12
Gross Sales:                    $55,988.05
───────────────────────────────────────────
ACoS (Advertising/Sales):       40.0%

Industry benchmarks:
  - Good ACoS:                  15-25%
  - Acceptable for launch:      25-35%
  - Targon LLC:                 40.0%  ← CRITICAL
```

**Total ACoS (TACoS)** including all Amazon fees:
```
Total Amazon Costs (Ads + FBA + Seller + Storage): $54,572.01
Gross Sales:                                       $55,988.05
TACoS:                                             97.5%

→ For every $1 in sales, $0.975 goes back to Amazon.
→ Only $0.025 per dollar remains — before product cost, warehousing, or OpEx.
```

### 3.5 FBA Fee Deep-Dive (from Journal Entries)

| FBA Fee Component                  | Amount       | Notes                           |
|------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| FBA Per Unit Fulfilment (Domestic) | $15,991.62  | Largest component                |
| FBA Per Unit Fulfilment (Intl)     | $42.88      | Minimal                         |
| FBA Inbound Transportation         | $2,899.74   | Includes $2,584 AWD processing  |
| Shipping Chargeback                | $570.75     | Customer shipping cost pass-thru |
| AWD Processing + Transport         | $1,137.11   | Multi-channel distribution       |
| Net FBA (after adjustments)        | $23,132.38  | Per P&L                         |

**Unit Economics Estimate (US-PDS as example):**
- US Revenue per settlement: ~$16,403 across ~2 months
- US FBA fees: ~$6,356 for those settlements
- FBA as % of US revenue: **38.7%**
- This suggests products are either:
  (a) bulky/heavy (dust sheets), driving high per-unit fulfilment costs, or
  (b) priced too low relative to size/weight

### 3.6 Warehousing Cost Analysis

| Component           | Amount     | Purpose                        |
|---------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 3PL US-PDS          | $5,007.34 | US third-party logistics       |
| AWD (Amazon)        | $925.88   | Amazon Warehousing & Distrib.  |
| Amazon FC           | $443.25   | Fulfilment center storage      |
| 3PL UK-PDS          | $419.23   | UK third-party logistics       |
| **Total**           | **$6,795.70** |                            |

The US warehousing cost ($5,007) is disproportionately high relative to US revenue ($16,413) at **30.5% of US revenue**. This may include one-time inbound shipping/prep costs for initial inventory loads.

### 4.2 Margin Analysis

| Metric                  | Value        | Assessment               |
|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Gross Margin            | -11.7%      | Loss before OpEx         |
| Operating Margin        | -79.1%      | Severe operating loss    |
| Net Margin              | -79.0%      | Unsustainable            |
| EBITDA Margin           | -79.0%      | No D&A to add back       |

### 4.3 Break-Even Analysis

**To break even on gross profit alone (COGS = Revenue):**
The company needs to either:
1. **Reduce COGS by $6,449** (10.5% reduction) — OR —
2. **Increase revenue by $6,449** while maintaining COGS — OR —
3. Some combination of both

**To break even including operating expenses ($36,963):**
```
Required revenue at current COGS structure (111.7%):
  → IMPOSSIBLE at current COGS ratios (COGS > 100%)
  → Must first achieve positive gross margin

Required COGS reduction to break even at current revenue:
  Target COGS: $54,918 - $36,963 = $17,955
  Current COGS: $61,368
  Required reduction: $43,413 (70.7% reduction)
  → Not achievable without fundamental business model change

Required revenue at target 40% gross margin:
  Revenue = OpEx / 0.40 = $36,963 / 0.40 = $92,407/period
  → Need ~$92K revenue with 40% gross margin to break even
  → At current monthly run rate of ~$23K, need ~4x growth PLUS
     margin improvement from -11.7% to 40%
```

### 4.4 Contribution Margin by Channel

| Channel | Revenue   | Est. Direct Costs* | Contribution | Margin  |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|-------------- |---------|
| UK-PDS  | $38,851   | ~$43,130            | -$4,279       | -11.0%  |
| US-PDS  | $15,936   | ~$18,107            | -$2,171       | -13.6%  |
| UK-CDS  | $131      | ~$131               | ~$0           | ~0%     |

*Estimated using proportional allocation of Amazon fees. US-PDS appears slightly worse due to higher warehousing costs.

### 5.2 Monthly Burn Rate Estimate

```
Total operating cash burn: -$111,267 over ~13 months
  → Average monthly burn: ~$8,559/month

But this is misleading. The inventory build ($61,795) is front-loaded.
Excluding inventory build-up:
  Recurring monthly operating burn: ($111,267 - $61,795) / 13 = ~$3,805/month

More accurate recent monthly burn (using Jan 2026 data):
  Jan revenue: ~$45,534
  Jan Amazon costs (from JEs): ~$41,186
  Monthly OpEx: ~$36,963/13 = ~$2,843/month
  → Net monthly burn (recent): ~$45,534 - $41,186 - $2,843 = +$1,505 on operations
  → BUT this excludes payroll, legal, rent which are lumpy
  → Realistic monthly burn including all OpEx: ~$5,000-8,000/month
```

### 5.3 Cash Runway

```
Current cash:                    $22,259
Monthly burn (conservative):     $8,000
Monthly burn (optimistic):       $5,000

Runway (conservative):           2.8 months (~mid-April 2026)
Runway (optimistic):             4.5 months (~late June 2026)

Amazon reserved balances:        $2,230 (not immediately accessible)
Credit card credits:             $10,935 (available to spend)

Effective liquidity:             $22,259 + $10,935 = $33,194
Extended runway (conservative):  4.1 months
Extended runway (optimistic):    6.6 months
```

**Critical Warning:** Without additional owner investment or path to profitability, the business will exhaust cash reserves by mid-2026.

### 5.4 Cash Conversion Cycle

```
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):     ~0 days (Amazon pays on settlement cycle)
Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO): $61,795 / ($61,368/395 days) × 1 = ~398 days ⚠️
Days Payable Outstanding (DPO):   $7,766 / ($61,368/395) × 1 = ~50 days

Cash Conversion Cycle:            0 + 398 - 50 = ~348 days

→ Extreme inventory overhang: nearly a year of inventory on hand
  relative to current sales velocity.
```

## 6. Working Capital Analysis

### 6.1 Liquidity Ratios

```
Current Assets:       $87,881.43
Current Liabilities:  -$2,267.27 (net credit — unusual)

Note: Negative liabilities stem from $10,935 credit card credit
balances. Adjusting to exclude CC credits:

Adjusted Current Liabilities: $7,766 (AP) + $902 (Other CL) = $8,668

Current Ratio:         $87,881 / $8,668 = 10.1x   (artificially high)
Quick Ratio:           ($87,881 - $61,795) / $8,668 = 3.0x
Cash Ratio:            $22,259 / $8,668 = 2.6x
```

**Assessment:** The ratios look healthy but are misleading. The current ratio is inflated by $61,795 in inventory that may be slow-moving. The quick ratio of 3.0x and cash ratio of 2.6x are genuinely healthy — the company has sufficient short-term liquidity relative to its obligations.

### 6.2 Working Capital Components

| Component              | Amount      | Days Outstanding |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Cash                   | $22,259     | —               |
| Inventory              | $61,795     | ~398 days ⚠️     |
| Amazon Reserves        | $2,230      | ~14 days        |
| Accounts Payable       | ($7,766)    | ~50 days        |
| CC Credits             | ($10,935)   | N/A (asset)     |
| **Net Working Capital** | **$90,149** |                 |

### 7.2 Inventory Efficiency Metrics

| Metric                      | Value     | Industry Benchmark | Assessment |
|-----------------------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Inventory-to-Sales Ratio    | 1.13x     | 0.15-0.30x        | 3-7x over  |
| Inventory Turnover          | 0.99x     | 4-8x annually     | Dangerously low |
| Days Inventory Outstanding  | ~398 days | 45-90 days        | Extreme    |
| Inventory / Total Assets    | 70.3%     | 20-40%            | Over-concentrated |

### 7.3 Key Observations

1. **All inventory is US-PDS:** No UK inventory on the balance sheet, suggesting UK products are either sourced locally, drop-shipped, or the UK inventory is held by the 3PL/Amazon and not capitalized.

2. **Inventory exceeds revenue:** $61,795 in inventory vs. $54,918 in total revenue means the company holds more product value than it has ever sold. This is typical of a pre-scale business that purchased initial bulk inventory.

3. **Manufacturing concentration:** The $47,783 in manufacturing costs suggests a single large production order from the Chinese manufacturer (JIANGSU ZHEWEI). The remaining $6,915 balance on the AP to this vendor confirms a $13,831 purchase order where 50% was paid.

4. **Freight capitalization:** $8,130 in freight costs have been properly capitalized into inventory, representing the landed cost of importing goods.

5. **Slow-moving risk:** At the January 2026 US-PDS revenue run rate of ~$16,403/month, it would take approximately 3.8 months to sell through the current US inventory (at cost) — but this assumes 100% of revenue converts directly to inventory consumption, which it does not (COGS includes fees). Actual inventory depletion is slower.

### 7.4 Inventory Liquidation Analysis

```
US-PDS Inventory:               $61,795
US-PDS Monthly Revenue:         ~$16,403 (Jan 2026 rate)
Estimated product cost % of rev: ~20% (rough estimate after Amazon fees)
Monthly inventory consumption:   ~$3,281
Months to liquidate:            ~18.8 months ⚠️

### 8.1 Operating Expense Breakdown

```
OpEx Category            Amount     % of Rev   % of OpEx   Assessment

### 8.2 Payroll Analysis

```
Wages:                   $16,000.00  (13 months = ~$1,231/month)
Payroll Taxes:           $1,466.00
Other Payroll:           $4,429.74   (benefits, workers' comp, etc.)
Total Payroll:           $21,895.74

Payroll as % of Revenue: 39.9%  ← Typical early-stage, but unsustainable
Monthly payroll cost:    ~$1,684/month

Assessment: The $16,000 in wages over 13 months (~$1,231/month) suggests
either a part-time employee or very low-cost labor. The $4,430 in "other
payroll" (28% of total payroll) seems disproportionate — likely includes
setup costs, onboarding, or payroll service fees.
```

### 8.3 Legal Expense Analysis

```
Legal fees:              $4,160.90
Accounting fees:         $741.21
Total:                   $4,902.11

Legal as % of revenue:   7.6%  ← Very high

Assessment: $4,161 in legal fees is significant for a <$55K revenue
business. Likely includes:
  - Entity formation / LLC operating agreement
  - Amazon seller account setup
  - UK market entry compliance
  - Trademark/IP protection
  - Import/customs documentation

This should be largely non-recurring. If legal costs continue at this
rate, it's a significant drag on profitability.
```

### 8.4 Rent Analysis

```
Monthly rent:            ~$309/month ($4,018 / 13 months)
Vendor: KSU Real Estate  $5,986 total purchases (includes security deposit $687)

Assessment: A physical space at ~$309/month is relatively inexpensive.
For an FBA-only business, a dedicated space may not be strictly necessary
if all inventory goes directly to Amazon/3PL warehouses. However, the
cost is modest enough that it likely serves as a home office or small
workspace for product inspection/prep.
```

### 8.5 Software & Technology Stack

```
Total software spend:    $1,280.67
Monthly:                 ~$99/month

Known vendors:
  - Claude.AI:           $496.28   (AI assistant — 38.8% of software)
  - OpenAI ChatGPT:      $400.00   (AI assistant — 31.2% of software)
  - Amazon Web Services:  $256.48  (Cloud services — 20.0%)
  - QuickBooks Payments:  $527.00  (Accounting — separate from software)
  - Google:              $695.08   (Likely Google Ads + Workspace)

Assessment: $896 combined on AI tools (Claude + ChatGPT) is notable.
If these tools are generating material productivity gains in product
research, listing optimization, or operations, the ROI could be
justified. Worth tracking the tangible output from these investments.

### 9.2 Owner Investment ROI

```
Total Owner Investment:          $156,117.06
Owner Draws:                     -$22,591.86
Net Owner Capital Deployed:      $133,525.20

Net Income (to date):            -$43,376.50
Unrealized Asset Value:          $61,795 (inventory) + $10,935 (CC credits)

Total Return:
  Cash return:                   -$43,377 (losses)
  + Remaining inventory:         +$61,795 (at cost)
  + CC credits:                  +$10,935
  = Net position vs. invested:   $90,149 equity vs $133,525 net invested
  = Loss of $43,376 or -32.5% of net capital deployed

Assessment: The owner has lost approximately $43K (32.5%) of deployed
capital, BUT $61,795 remains in inventory (a productive asset if
sellable) and $10,935 sits as CC credits. The true economic loss
depends on inventory recoverability.

## 10. Trend Analysis & Projections

### 10.1 Monthly Revenue Run Rate (from Journal Entries)

```
                Revenue
Dec 2025        $10          ← Business essentially just starting
Jan 2026        $45,534      ← First full month of real sales

Monthly Revenue Trend (by settlement):
Jan 1-16 UK:    $10,133
Jan 16-30 UK:   $19,001      ← 87.5% growth within the month
Jan 1-16 US:    $4,196
Jan 16-30 US:   $12,207      ← 190.9% growth within the month

→ Strong intra-month acceleration, especially US marketplace
→ If this trajectory holds, Feb 2026 could see $60-80K in revenue
```

### 10.2 Revenue Projection Scenarios

| Scenario      | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue | Assumptions |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Pessimistic   | $30,000         | $360,000       | Growth stalls, seasonal dip |
| Realistic     | $50,000         | $600,000       | Maintains Jan trajectory |
| Optimistic    | $75,000         | $900,000       | Continued acceleration |

### 10.3 Break-Even Scenarios

```
SCENARIO 1: Achieve 25% Gross Margin
  Required: Reduce Amazon fees from 99.4% to ~63% of revenue
  Actions: Cut ACoS from 40% to 20%, optimize FBA fees
  Revenue needed for break-even: $36,963 / 0.25 = $147,851/year = $12,321/month
  → Achievable at current revenue IF margins improve

SCENARIO 2: Maintain Current COGS Structure
  Gross margin: -11.7%
  → NEVER reaches break-even regardless of revenue
  → MUST reduce COGS

SCENARIO 3: Aggressive Cost Optimization
  Target ACoS: 20% (from 40%)    → Save $11,207
  Target FBA reduction: 10%       → Save $2,313
  Target seller fee reduction: 5% → Save $445
  New COGS: ~$47,403 (86.3% of revenue at $54,918)
  Gross margin: 13.7%
  Revenue for break-even: $36,963 / 0.137 = $269,803/year = $22,484/month
  → With January's $45K run rate, this is ACHIEVABLE if costs are controlled
```

### 10.4 When Could Breakeven Be Achieved?

```
Best-case scenario:
  - ACoS drops to 20% by Q2 2026 (organic ranking improves)
  - Revenue grows to $60K/month
  - Gross margin reaches 25%
  - Break-even on operating basis: Q3 2026 (July-Aug)

Realistic scenario:
  - ACoS drops to 25% by Q3 2026
  - Revenue stabilizes at $50K/month
  - Gross margin reaches 15%
  - Break-even on operating basis: Q4 2026 (Nov-Dec)

Pessimistic scenario:
  - ACoS remains above 30%
  - Revenue flat at $40K/month
  - Gross margin stays negative
  - Break-even: NOT ACHIEVABLE without business model changes
```

## 11. Peer Benchmarking — Amazon FBA Industry Comparison

### 11.1 Key Metrics vs. Industry

```
Metric                    Targon LLC    FBA Average    Top Quartile
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ACoS (Ad Cost/Sales)      40.0%         15-25%         8-15%
Total Amazon Fees/Sales   97.5%         40-55%         30-40%
Gross Margin              -11.7%        25-40%         40-55%
Net Margin                -79.0%        5-15%          15-25%
Refund Rate               1.9%          3-5%           <2%
Inventory Turnover        1.0x          6-12x          12-20x
Revenue/Employee          $54,918       $200-500K      $500K+
```

### 11.2 ACoS Context

The 40% ACoS is consistent with a **new product launch strategy**. Amazon sellers commonly run ACoS at 40-60%+ during the first 3-6 months to:
- Build product ranking and Best Seller Rank (BSR)
- Generate reviews and social proof
- Establish organic search visibility

**This is expected for a launch phase but must decline to 15-25% within 6-12 months** to become viable. If ACoS does not improve, it signals fundamental product-market fit issues.

### 11.3 Category Context (Dust Sheets / Home Products)

Dust sheets is a relatively niche category with:
- Lower average selling prices
- Moderate competition
- Seasonal demand patterns (construction/renovation seasons)
- Generally thin margins due to commodity-like nature

The product category may inherently limit achievable margins, making operational efficiency even more critical.

### 12.3 Sensitivity Analysis

```
Impact of ACoS Changes on Gross Margin:
  ACoS 40% (current):  Gross Margin = -11.7%
  ACoS 35%:            Gross Margin = -6.7%
  ACoS 30%:            Gross Margin = -1.6%
  ACoS 25%:            Gross Margin = +3.3%   ← First positive margin
  ACoS 20%:            Gross Margin = +8.4%
  ACoS 15%:            Gross Margin = +13.4%

Impact of Revenue Growth at Improved 25% ACoS:
  Revenue $45K/mo:     Monthly GP = $2,498     OpEx = ~$2,843  → Loss $345
  Revenue $50K/mo:     Monthly GP = $2,775     OpEx = ~$2,843  → Loss $68
  Revenue $55K/mo:     Monthly GP = $3,053     OpEx = ~$2,843  → PROFIT $210 ✓
  Revenue $60K/mo:     Monthly GP = $3,330     OpEx = ~$2,843  → PROFIT $487 ✓
  Revenue $75K/mo:     Monthly GP = $4,163     OpEx = ~$2,843  → PROFIT $1,320 ✓

→ The path to profitability requires BOTH ACoS reduction to ~25%
  AND revenue sustaining above $50K/month.
```

### 12.4 Concentration Risks

```
Revenue Concentration:
  ├─ Platform:    100% Amazon        ← EXTREME
  ├─ Geography:   71% UK, 29% US    ← HIGH (UK)
  ├─ Product:     ~100% Dust Sheets  ← EXTREME
  └─ Customer:    100% B2C via FBA   ← HIGH

Supplier Concentration:
  ├─ Manufacturing: 1 supplier (JIANGSU ZHEWEI) ← EXTREME
  └─ Logistics: Multiple 3PLs + Amazon ← ACCEPTABLE

Funding Concentration:
  └─ 100% Owner equity ← EXTREME (single point of failure)
```

## Appendix A: Credit Card Credit Balances

The $10,935 credit balance on credit cards (Amex $10,636 + Chase Ink $299) is unusual. Possible explanations:
1. **Refunds/returns** from business purchases credited back
2. **Overpayment** of credit card bills
3. **Reward/cash-back credits** accumulated
4. **Amazon settlement payments** routed through CC then refunded

This amount represents available spending capacity and should be treated as a liquid asset in runway calculations.

## Appendix B: Accounts Payable Detail

| Vendor                          | Amount    | Status           | Notes |
|---------------------------------|-----------|------------------|-------|
| JIANGSU ZHEWEI ELECTROMECHANICAL | $6,915.38 | 31-60 days past due | 50% balance on $13,831 manufacturing order |
| V Global Logistics (4 invoices) | $438.09   | Mixed current/past due | UK logistics partner |
| AMS Business Accountants        | $147.24   | 1-30 days past due | UK accounting firm |
| Tactical Logistic Solutions     | $187.60   | 1-30 days past due | US logistics |
| CAKE AFFAIRS LAYYAH             | $12.51    | 1-30 days past due | Misc |
| **Total AP**                    | **$7,765.81** | | |

**Note:** The $6,915 past-due amount to the Chinese manufacturer is the most significant. This should be prioritized to maintain supplier relationship for future orders.

## Appendix C: Data Limitations & Caveats

1. **Period mismatch:** P&L covers 13 months but actual selling activity appears to be ~3-4 months. Ratios using full-period revenue may understate the true run rate.
2. **No unit-level data:** Without SKU-level sales data, unit economics are estimated.
3. **No prior period:** This is effectively a startup — no year-over-year comparison is possible.
4. **Inventory aging:** No data on individual SKU velocity or aging; the entire inventory balance could be current or partially stale.
5. **Retained earnings of -$35,002:** This indicates the company had losses in a prior fiscal year as well, suggesting the business has been losing money since inception.
6. **Balance sheet Net Income discrepancy:** The balance sheet shows net income of -$8,374 (current period) while the P&L shows -$43,377 (full period). The difference of $35,002 matches the retained earnings, confirming the fiscal year rolled over and prior losses were moved to retained earnings.
